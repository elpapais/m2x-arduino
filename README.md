m2x-arduino
===========

How to Use
==========

This library depends on [jsonlite](https://github.com/amamchur/jsonlite), the following steps are needed now:

1. Clone the [jsonlite](https://github.com/amamchur/jsonlite) repository.
2. Open the Arduino app, click `Sketch->Import Library...->Add Library...`, then navigate to `amalgamated/jsonlite` folder in the cloned jsonlite repository. The jsonlite library will be imported to Arduino this way.
3. Use the same way as #2 to import `M2XStreamClient` library in the current folder.
4. Now you can find M2X examples under `File->Examples->M2XStreamClient`
5. Enjoy coding!
